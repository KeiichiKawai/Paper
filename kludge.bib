	earned in a continuous-time Markov decision process with countable
	state and finite action space. (The reward rate is merely bounded
	by a polynomial.) By examining a sequence <tex-math>$\langle P_{N}\rangle
	$</tex-math> of approximating problems, each of which is a semi-Markov
	decision process with exponential transition rate ? <sub>N</sub>,
	<tex-math>$\Lambda _{N}\nearrow \infty $</tex-math>, we are able
	to show that P is obtained as the limit of the P<sub>N</sub>. The
	value in representing P as the limit of P<sub>N</sub> is that structural
	properties present in each P<sub>N</sub> persist, in both the finite
	and the infinite horizon problem. Three queuing optimization models
	illustrating the method are given.},

	decisions so that the details of the internal process are irrelevant?
	I develop a model which illustrates a limitation of adaptive processes:
	improvements tend to come in the form of kludges. A kludge is a marginal
	adaptation that compensates for, but does not eliminate, fundamental
	design inefficiencies. When kludges accumulate, the result can be
	perpetually suboptimal behavior even in a model of evolution in which
	arbitrarily large innovations occur infinitely, often with probability
	1.},

@article{Lippman_1975,
	Abstract = {Using the technique employed by the author in an earlier paper, the
	existence of an optimal stationary policy that can be obtained from
	the usual functional equation is again established in the presence
	of a bound (not necessarily polynomial) on the one-period reward
	of a semi-Markov decision process. This is done for both the discounted
	and the average cost case. In addition to allowing an uncountable
	state space, the law of motion of the system is rather general in
	that we permit any state to be reached in a single transition. There
	is, however, a bound on a weighted moment of the next state reached.
	Finally, we indicate the applicability of these results.},

@article{Morris_Coate_1999,
	Abstract = {Policy persistence refers to the tendency of the political process
	to maintain policies once they have been introduced. This paper develops
	a theory of policy persistence based on the idea that policies create
	incentives for beneficiaries to take actions which increase their
	willingness to pay for these policies in the future. The theory is
	used to show that policy persistence may lead to political failure,
	in the sense that policy sequences arising in political equilibrium
	can be Pareto dominated.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another
	version of this item.)},

@article{Alesina_Drazen,
	Abstract = { When a stabilization has significant distributional implications
	(e.g., tax increases to eliminate a large budget deficit), socioeconomic
	groups may attempt to shift the burden of stabilization onto other
	groups. The process leading to stabilization becomes a \&quot;war
	of attrition,\&quot; each group attempting to wait the others out
	and stabilization occurring only when one group concedes and bears
	a disproportionate share of the burden. The authors solve for the
	expected time of stabilization in a model of \&quot;rational\&quot;
	delay and relate it to several political and economic variables.
	They motivate this approach and its results by comparison to historical
	and current episodes. Copyright 1991 by American Economic Association.},
